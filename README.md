# Predictive Student Learning Assessment Project

This is a repo for Jing Yu and Dian Rong's CSC311 Final Project, focused on predicting students' correctness of diagnostic questions by using various Machine Learning algorithms.

You can find the project report [here](final_report.pdf)

## Background
Online education platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera provide access to high-quality education but struggle to measure students' understanding effectively. Diagnostic questions, designed to highlight common misconceptions, play a crucial role in assessing students' knowledge. This project aims to build machine learning models to predict students' responses to these questions based on their past interactions and other students' data.


## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the subsampled dataset from the online education platform.
- `part_a/`: Includes implementation of basic machine learning algorithms.
- `part_b/`: Includes modified implementation of basic machine learning algorithms.
- `final_report.pdf`: Contains the results obtained from different models and evaluations.
